# DL-Open-Projects

This repo will contain the code for introductory Deep Learning Projects:

- Naive Bayes Classifier: 
A Bayesian classifier for weather data implemented in Python

- MLP using NumPy: 
Implementations of multi-layer perceptrons (single layer and multi-layer) from scratch using only NumPy.

- Titanic Survival Prediction Model using DNN: 
A Deep Neural Network model which will be used to predict the survival of passengers.

- MNIST Classification using Deep Learning: 
Implementations of Logistic Regression, MLP(s) and a CNN (LeNet) in PyTorch to perform classification on the MNIST dataset.
